Hi there!

I used this youtube.com video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEAav7dM4hk) and followed it very closely to create this little app that basically holds information
about some people, first name and last name. What is interesting is that it does this using the coreData interface that
xCode provides. It will be interesting to move forward with this. I don't think we'll be saving settings like this in our
app, but maybe we could keep 'nights out drinking' saved in a database like this and do some fun things with the data.

We shall see!
